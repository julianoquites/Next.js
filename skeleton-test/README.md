# Skeleton Component test
## Just a test using shacdn UI to create a skeleton component with Next.js 13 and TailwindCSS. Very simple to do and very intuitive.

# HOW TO SETUP
## First you need to `npm install` the dependencies and create a `.env.local` file on the main folder with a variable named **RAWG** and add the free API key that you can get in https://rawg.io/apidocs to it. Next you need to install the shadcn UI CLI with the `npx shadcn-ui init` command. And you are done :)
